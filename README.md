# facebook_edgewebview2
This application just uses facebook.com, running on EdgeWebView2.
<br>
This application is created using Visual Basic 2015. 
<br>
I created this application, because Facebook pulled out their "real" windows app. But, they rereleased a PWA one in the Microsoft Store. 
<br>
I recreated that PWA version into an actual webapp using EdgeWebView2.
